# Irrigation System Optimization

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at optimizing an irrigation system using sensor data. The project leverages various machine learning techniques to predict irrigation needs for different parcels of land based on environmental sensor readings.

## Project Overview

[cite\_start]The core of this project is an `Irrigation_System.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook [cite: 1] that demonstrates:

  - Data loading and initial exploration.
  - [cite\_start]Data preprocessing (likely including scaling, given the `MinMaxScaler` import [cite: 1]).
  - [cite\_start]Training a multi-output classification model using `RandomForestClassifier` and `MultiOutputClassifier` from `scikit-learn`[cite: 1].
  - [cite\_start]Evaluating the model's performance using classification metrics[cite: 1].
  - [cite\_start]Saving the trained model for future use (`joblib` is imported for this purpose [cite: 1]).

[cite\_start]The objective is to intelligently decide when and how to irrigate `parcel_0`, `parcel_1`, and `parcel_2` based on the input from `sensor_0` through `sensor_19`[cite: 1, 2].

## Dataset

[cite\_start]The `irrigation_machine.csv` file [cite: 2] serves as the dataset for this project. It contains:

  - [cite\_start]**Sensor Readings**: Columns from `sensor_0` to `sensor_19` representing various environmental or machine sensor data[cite: 2].
  - [cite\_start]**Parcel Status**: Columns `parcel_0`, `parcel_1`, and `parcel_2` which are the target variables indicating the irrigation status or needs for respective parcels[cite: 2].

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `joblib`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
```

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  [cite\_start]**Place the dataset:** Ensure the `irrigation_machine.csv` file is in the same directory as the `Irrigation_System.ipynb` notebook[cite: 1].

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Irrigation_System.ipynb
    ```

    Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
